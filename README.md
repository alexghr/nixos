# Nix configuration

This repo contains the Nix configuration for the various machines I use. I'm
new to Nix/NixOS and its ecosystem so a lot of the code you'll see here might
not be its best.

## Flakes

When I first started using NixOS I used the standard configuration at
`/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`. This worked well for me while I was managing
only one machine. As I installed Nix on more and more machines I wanted a more
elegant way to manage shared configuration. So I arrived at Flakes.

This repo is a mix of Flakes and non-Flakes configuration, but most of the
hosts I use daily have been converted to Flakes.

For an intro to flakes I recommend the [original Tweag Flakes intro] on using
Nix Flakes to manage a NixOS system.

For other example configs on Github, have a look at this list I made
[nix-configs].

## Btrfs & backups

In before people get triggered, I use Btrfs on all of my machines (including
a raspi's SDCard). It's great üëå

To prevent sadness in case something goes wrong in the future I back up daily
to Backblaze. See my custom [restic module] for that

## Hosts

The [./hosts] directory contains the configuration files for my machines.
I name all of my machines after Star Trek* characters.

Multiple configurations could be applied to the same machine. That's because
I dual boot sometimes.

Current computers:

- üñ•Ô∏è [vader] - Main NixOS install
- üíª [ishuttle] - A macbook running [nix-darwin] & [home-manager]
- <img alt="raspi" src="./.github/img/raspi.png" style="height:1.5em;vertical-align:middle"/> [hk47] -
  A Raspberry Pi 4B in my closet. Mainly runs the Unifi controller
- üñ•Ô∏è [nix-1] - A Hetzner VPS. Runs k3s
- üíÄ [stormtrooper] - First time I installed Nix on WSL. Mostly to experiment.
  Preceded [nixtrooper]
- üíÄ [wsltrooper] - Second time I installed Nix on WSL to test Flakes
- üíÄ [nixtrooper] - First NixOS install on bare metal. Preceded [vader]

## System management

Most of the time it boils down to this:

- make a change in this repo (e.g. add a new package, add a new env var)
- execute

  ```shell
  $ sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /path/to/git/repo
  ```

  alternatively, you can push the change to Github and run

  ```shell
  $ sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake github:alexghr/nix
  ```

`nixos-rebuild` will default to apply the `nixosConfiguration` named after the
current system's hostname, so the above command is equivalent to

```shell
$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake github:alexghr/nix#$(hostname)
```

## Todo

- [ ] remove stale hosts
- [ ] migrate other machines to Flakes
- [ ] setup CI (update flakes, push derivations to cachix, etc)
